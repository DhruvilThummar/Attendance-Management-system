Full Implementation Plan: Smart Attendance Management System
A robust, role-based system for automating attendance, explicitly designed to satisfy the SEM III Python-1 & FSD-1 syllabus.

🚀 Tech Stack
Backend: Flask (Python)
Database: Pure PostgreSQL (using Raw SQL via psycopg2)
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Vanilla + Bootstrap 5), JS (ES6)
Reporting: ReportLab / WeasyPrint
Analytics: Matplotlib (Visualization), Custom BST (Data Structures)
Frontend Responsibilities (FSD-1 Alignment)
Responsive dashboards using Bootstrap 5.
Dynamic attendance updates via JS (ES6 + AJAX/Fetch).
Real-time filters and Matplotlib chart integration.
Comprehensive client-side validation.

🧠 Syllabus Alignment (Unit 4-10)
Unit	Topic	Implementation
4 & 5	Data Structures	BST for Student lookup; Lists/Dicts/Sets for reports.
6	File Handling	file_service: Attendance data persistence & PDF metadata.
7	Modules & OS	system_service: Report directory auto-management & backups.
8	Exceptions/OOP	Custom Exceptions (InvalidAttendanceError); Abstraction.
9	OOP Advanced	Inheritance (User->Student/HOD) & Polymorphism.
10	Visualization	Matplotlib: Attendance histograms & subject-wise charts.

🛠️ Key Features
1. Authentication & RBAC
Secure login for Admin, HOD, Faculty, and Student.
Protected routes using custom Flask decorators.
2. Attendance Rules & Defaulter Engine [NEW]
Enforces 75% minimum threshold.
Auto-generates Defaulter Lists per subject and division.
Flags maintenance for HOD/Admin review.
3. Student Warning & Notification System [NEW]
In-app notifications when attendance drops below threshold.
Defaulter summaries for HOD/Admin dashboards.
4. Report Generation Suite [NEW]
Daily Attendance Report
Weekly Summary Report
Monthly Attendance Report
Defaulter List Report
Subject-wise Attendance Report
5. Lecture Auto-Generation Engine
Inputs: Timetable + Academic Calendar.
Auto-creates Lecture records for valid working days.
6. Student Search (BST Optimization)
O(log n) enrollment-based search for real-time dashboard performance.
The BST is initialized at application startup from the student database and updated on every student insert, update, and delete operation to ensure real-time consistency.
7. Attendance Correction & Audit System
Faculty modification of records with a full Audit Trail.
8. Timetable Management [NEW]
Admin defines weekly schedules mapping Subjects, Faculties, and Divisions to time slots, which feed the Lecture Auto-Generation Engine.
9. Exception Handling [NEW]
Implemented in calendar_service, attendance_service, and rules_service using custom exception classes and try–except blocks for validation and data integrity (Unit-8).
10. Data Backup & Recovery
Automated backups to /static/reports/backups/.
11. Subject & Division Management [NEW]
Admin can create, update, and assign Subjects and Divisions to students and faculties, forming the foundation of the timetable and attendance workflow.

🗃️ Database Schema (Raw SQL + DBMS)
Engine: PostgreSQL accessed via psycopg2.
Logic: All queries written as raw SQL strings for explicit DBMS demonstration.
Operations: CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY.
users: id, email, password, role (Admin, HOD, Faculty, Student)
hods: id, user_id, department_id
students: id, user_id, enrollment_no, division_id
subjects: id, code, name
divisions: id, name, semester
timetable: id, subject_id, faculty_id, division_id, day, slot
lectures: id, timetable_id, date
attendance: id, lecture_id, student_id, status (P/A)
attendance_audit: attendance_id, old_status, new_status, edited_by, edited_at
notifications: id, user_id, message, seen, created_at [NEW]
complaints: id, student_id, faculty_id, message, status

✅ Verification Plan
Rules: Verify threshold logic triggers defaulter flagging.
Notifications: Ensure students receive warnings immediately upon low attendance update.
Reports: Validate all 5 report types generate accurate PDF content.
Audit: Modify attendance and verify log entry creation.
Visualization: Verify charts reflect correct percentages for diverse roles.
